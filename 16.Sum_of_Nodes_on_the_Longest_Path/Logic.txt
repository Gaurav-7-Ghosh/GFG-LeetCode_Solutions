Here we perform a BFS approach where we store each node along with the sum at the current node in a queue.

When we traverse a leaf node then we check if the level of the current node is more or equal to the current max level discovered.

If equal then we compare the current sum with the maxsum and update as needed.
If more then we update both the maxlevel and mxsum to the currsum and the current level.
