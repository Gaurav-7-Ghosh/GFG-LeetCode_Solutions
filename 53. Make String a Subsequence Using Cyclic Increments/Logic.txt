Here we do we a simple two pointer approach starting from the left(index 0) for both strings

we iterate over both strings checking for either a match or if we cyclic increment the character of string 1 and 
then can match

Termination condition is when either i or j loop ends

Success if we have iterated over the entire second string which means we have been able to match
