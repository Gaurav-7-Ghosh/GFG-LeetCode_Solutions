Here we simply perform a recursive permutation function forming all possible binary strings of size n beginning with
"1" and then perform adding to the results vector if we check if it has atleast more or equal number of 1's as zeros.

For the prefix part we keep a count of current no of 1's and 0's in the string and if at any time the no of 0's is greater we stop the recursive call and return.
