here we construct a recursion where we are looking to find the energy needed to reach step (n-1) [assuming 0 based indexing]

So we can start with the base case where the enery required to reach step 0 from 0 is 0. 

then we call recursively for one step jump and two step jump. Also we keep a check that for step -2 whether it is possible or not.
