Here since we only care that the dominos numbers match either as a==c or a==d then we can normalize the 
dominoes
Treating [1,2] and [2,1] as [1,2] and [1,2]

Also then since in essence we are checking whether the same pair of numbers are there in the domino we
can normalize them to the form of [a,b] where a<=b and then normalize them. 

We initialize a count to keep track of the occurences of the unique normalized values. 
Then we iterate through the array and for each occurence we add them to the result and then increment iterate
it's occurence count. 
This is done so that for the first occurence result does not change and only from the second occurence we 
add 1 to the result
