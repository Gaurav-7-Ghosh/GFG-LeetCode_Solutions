Here the key thing to notice is the given meetings timings are non-overlapping

So when we look at the timeline from o to eventTime we can see there are say n meetings and therefore there will be n+1 gap slots
One slot before the first meeting, one after the last meeting and n-1 slots meeting the n-Meetings

Also to be noticed is that in the timeline we can either shift each meeting to its left or right depending on gap slots
Logically it would be beneficial if we could move consequtive meetings in order to maximize a single gap slot

To convert this into a sliding window problem, we count the gaps in the eventTime

Intuition
Taking a window of k+1 (Since at most we can reschedule k meetings we can get k+1 gap slots together by slotting the k meetings one after the another)

So we perform a max of k+1 gap slots over the eventTime
