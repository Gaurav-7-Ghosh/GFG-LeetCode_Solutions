Look at Q81.

Here the question is quite similar apart from the fact that we can also re-arrange meetings.

So apart from the logic in Q81 where we can either move meeting to its left or right, 
we can also remove that meeting from its slot and take freeTime = freeTimeonLeft + meetingTime + freeTimeonRight if any other gap is of the length of the removed meeting. 

Then from both these cases we return the max.
