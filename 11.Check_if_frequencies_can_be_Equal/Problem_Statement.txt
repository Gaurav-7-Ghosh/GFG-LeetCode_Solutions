Given a string s which contains only lower alphabetic characters, check if it is possible to remove at most one character from this string in such a way that frequency of each distinct character becomes same in the string. Return true if it is possible to do else return false.

Note: The driver code print 1 if the value returned is true, otherwise 0.

Example 1:

Input:
s = "xyyz"
Output: 
1 
Explanation: 
Removing one 'y' will make frequency of each character to be 1.
Example 2:

Input:
s = "xxxxyyzz"
Output: 
0
Explanation: 
Frequency can not be made same by removing at most one character
