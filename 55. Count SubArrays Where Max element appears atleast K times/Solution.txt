Intuition

Find the maximum value in the array.

Slide a window using two pointers (left, right).

Count how many times the maximum appears inside the window.

When count â‰¥ k (i.e., enough maximums inside window):

Every subarray starting from left to right and beyond is valid.

So, add (n - right) to the result.

Move left to keep counting only minimal valid windows.

Approach

Identify the maximum value in the array nums.

Initialize two pointers (left = 0, right = 0) and a counter to track occurrences of maxValue inside the window.

Expand the window by moving right pointer and update the count of maxValue in the window.

If the count of maxValue >= k, start moving the left pointer to shrink the window:

For each valid window where count >= k, add (n - right) to the result.

Continue until you've processed all possible windows.

Time complexity : O(n)
Space complexity : O(1)
