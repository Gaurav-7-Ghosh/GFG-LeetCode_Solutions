Approach: Dynamic Programming

Intuition

The task is to find the longest subsequence in 0,1,...,n−1, where the subsequence satisfies two conditions: the values of the groups corresponding 
to adjacent indices are different, and the Hamming distance between the words corresponding to adjacent indices is 1. This is similar to 
"Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence I," where we can still use dynamic programming to solve the problem.

Let dp[i] represent the length of the longest subsequence ending at index i, and let HammingDistance(s,t) represent 
the Hamming distance between two strings s and t. If index i can be added after index j in the subsequence, then it must satisfy groups[i]

=groups[j] for j<i, and HammingDistance(words[i],words[j])=1. When these conditions hold, the length of the longest subsequence ending at index i 
is updated as dp[i]=max(dp[i],dp[j]+1).

We can obtain the dynamic programming recurrence formula as follows:

dp[i]=max(dp[i],dp[j]+1) if (groups[i] != group[j] && HammingDistance(words[i],words[j])=1)


For each index i, we enumerate the indices before i to find the length of the longest subsequence ending at i. 
By performing this for each index, we can find the length of the longest subsequence in [0,1,...,n−1]. To facilitate the calculation, 
we use prev[i] to record the index of the previous index in the longest subsequence ending at i. Once we identify the ending index i of the 
longest subsequence, we can trace back through the indices to recover the entire subsequence and add the corresponding strings to an array. 

Reversing this array gives us the final answer.
