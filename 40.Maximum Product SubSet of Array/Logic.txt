Approach 
Initialize Variables:

ans is initialized to 1, which will hold the product of the elements.
mx is initialized to INT_MIN, which will hold the maximum negative number encountered in the array.
Iterate Through the Array:

For each element in the array, if the element is not 0, multiply it to ans and take modulo 1000000007.
If the element is negative and greater than mx, update mx to this element.
Handle Negative Product:

After the loop, if the product (ans) is negative, divide ans by the maximum negative number mx to try to make the product positive or less negative.
If the product is non-negative, simply return it.
